                We are a new company with a simple goal. To expand. FireSquad Legion is a company within New World that is aligned
                with the Syndicate faction. Though we primarily function within New World, we will be expanding into other
                team based games in the future. We are based in North America with players from both Canada and the USA and we don't discriminate! (except for
                DownNDirty, he will judge you if you aren't from the US ;) ). We are always open to new ideas and concepts
                as we are a new company so don't be shy. FireSquad Legion is a company that is interested in a variety of activities like
                crafting, dungeon running, and Syndicate grinding. We are also looking to expand into the PvP scenario with scheduled
                events as wars between factions and other PvP events occur in the future. Because PvP events in New World heavily
                rely on teamwork and coordination we need you! However, if you are tired of playing alone and want a friendly buddy or two to help you
                on your journey just click that discord button and say hello! I promise we don't bite. TEST
